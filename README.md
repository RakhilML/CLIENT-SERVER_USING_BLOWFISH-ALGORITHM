# CLIENT-SERVER_USING_BLOWFISH-ALGORITHM
The server generates a private key (serverPrivateKey). It receives the client’s values for p, g, and clientPublicKey over the established connection. The server calculates its public key (serverPublicKey) using the received values and sends it back to the client. It computes the shared secret key (clientSharedKey) using the client’s public key.
